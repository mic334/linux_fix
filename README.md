# Iqmol Inatall

This repository was created because **IQmol is no longer working on Ubuntu 22.04 and later versions**.  
As an alternative, Molden was compiled from source and the necessary steps and files were collected here for future reference.


## Repository Structure

This repository contains all the necessary material to install and run **IQmol** on modern Linux systems where the official binaries no longer work (Ubuntu 22.04 and later).

The content is organized as follows:

- `fake_qt_package/`  
  Contains a fake or patched Qt package used to ensure compatibility with newer Linux distributions.

- `iqmol_exe/`  
  Contains the IQmol executable and related files.

- `how_to_install/`  
  Contains documentation and step-by-step instructions describing the installation procedure.

Each folder includes all the files required for its specific purpose. Please refer to the `how_to_install` directory for detailed installation instructions.

## Notes

This repository is intended as a practical reference for users working on modern Linux distributions where precompiled binaries or alternative visualization tools may not be available.

Feel free to explore the folders and adapt the setup to your system.

## Acknowledgement

The installation procedure described in this repository is **not originally mine**.  
It is based on the instructions available at the following link, which I adapted and organized here for convenience:
